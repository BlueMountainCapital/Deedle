/// The `Series` module provides F#-friendly API for working with functions. The API
/// follows the usual design for collection-processing in F#, so the functions work
/// well with the pipelining (`|>`) operator. For example, given a series with ages,
/// we can use `Series.filterValues` to filter outliers and then `Series.mean` to calculate
/// the mean:
///
///     ages
///     |> Series.filterValues (fun v -> v > 0.0 && v < 120.0)
///     |> Series.mean
///
/// The module provides comprehensive set of functions for working with series. The same
/// API is also exposed using C#-friendly extension methods. In C#, the above snippet could
/// be written as:
///
///     [lang=csharp]
///     ages
///       .Where(kvp => kvp.Value > 0.0 && kvp.Value < 120.0)
///       .Mean()
/// 
/// For more information about similar frame-manipulation functions, see the `Frame` module.
/// For more information about C#-friendly extensions, see `SeriesExtensions`. The functions 
/// in the `Series` module are grouped in a number of categories and documented below.
///
/// ## Accessing series data and lookup
///
/// Functions in this category provide access to the values in the series.
///
///  - The term _observation_ is used for a key value pair in the series. 
///  - When working with a sorted series, it is possible to perform lookup using
///    keys that are not present in the series - you can specify to search for the
///    previous or next available value using _lookup behavior_.
///  - Functions such as `get` and `getAll` have their counterparts `lookup` and
///    `lookupAll` that let you specify lookup behavior.
///  - For most of the functions that may fail, there is a `try[Foo]` variant that
///    returns `None` instead of failing.
///  - Functions with a name ending with `At` perform lookup based on the absolute
///    integer offset (and ignore the keys of the series)
///

///
/// > **TODO** Write comment here  
/// > **TODO** Document functions in this category
///
/// 
/// ## Hierarchical index operations
///
/// > **TODO** Write comment here
///
/// 
/// ## Windowing, chunking and grouping
///
/// This category includes functions that group data from a series in some way. Two key
/// concepts here are _window_ and _chunk_. Window refers to (overlapping) sliding windows
/// over the input series while chunk refers to non-overlapping blocks of the series.
///
/// The boundary behavior can be specified using the `Boundary` flags. The value 
/// `Skip` means that boundaries (incomplete windows or chunks) should be skipped. The value
/// `AtBeginning` and `AtEnding` can be used to define at which side should the boundary be
/// returned (or skipped). For chunking, `AtBeginning ||| Skip` makes sense and it means that
/// the incomplete chunk at the beginning should be skipped (aligning the last chunk with the end).
///
/// The behavior may be specified in a number of ways (which is reflected in the name):
///  - `dist` - using an absolute distance between the keys
///  - `while` - using a condition on the first and last key
///  - `size` - by specifying the absolute size of the window/chunk
///
/// The functions ending with `Into` take a function to be applied to the window/chunk. 
/// The functions `window`, `windowInto` and `chunk`, `chunkInto` are simplified versions
/// that take a size. There is also `pairwise` function for sliding window of size two.
///
