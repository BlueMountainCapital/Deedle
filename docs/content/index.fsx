Deedle: Exploratory data library for .NET
=========================================

Deedle is an easy to use library for data and time series manipulation and for scientific 
programming. It supports working with structured data frames, ordered and unordered data, 
as well as time series. Deedle is designed to work well for exploratory programming using 
F# and C# interactive console, but can be also used in efficient compiled .NET code.

The library implements a wide range of operations for data manipulation including 
advanced indexing and slicing, joining and aligning data, handling of missing values,
grouping and aggregation, statistics and more. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">

Titanic survivor analysis in 20 lines
-------------------------------------

Assume we loaded [Titanic data set](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) 
into a data frame called `titanic` (the data frame has numerous columns including string 
`Sex` and Boolean `Survived`). Now we can calculate the survival rates for males and females:

<div id="hp-snippet">
*)
// Group the data frame by sex 
let grouped = titanic |> Frame.groupRowsByString "Sex" |> Frame.nest

// For each group, calculate the total number of survived & died
let bySex =
  grouped
  |> Series.map (fun sex df -> 
      // Group by the 'Survived' column & count by Boolean values
      df.GetColumn<bool>("Survived") |> Series.groupBy (fun k v -> v) 
      |> Frame.ofColumns |> Frame.countValues )
  |> Frame.ofRows
  |> Frame.indexColsWith ["Died"; "Survived"]

// Add column with Total number of males/females on Titanic
bySex?Total <- Frame.countRows $ grouped

// Build a data frame with nice summary of rates in percents
[ "Died (%)" => bySex?Died / bySex?Total * 100.0
  "Survived (%)" => bySex?Survived / bySex?Total * 100.0 ]
|> Frame.ofColumns

(**
We first group data by the `Sex` column and get a series (with rows `male` and `female`)
containing data frames for individual groups. Then we count the number of survivors in
each group, add the total number of males and females and, finally, build a new data frame
with the summary:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<thead><tr><td></td><td>Died (%)</td><td>Survived (%)</td></tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td class="title">Female</td><td>25.80</td><td>74.20</td></tr></thead>
  <tr><td class="title">Male</td><td>81.11</td><td>18.89</td></tr></thead>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

Samples & documentation
-----------------------

The library comes with comprehensible documentation. The tutorials and articles are 
automatically generated from `*.fsx` files in [the samples folder][samples]. The API
reference is automatically generated from Markdown comments in the library implementation.

 * [Quick start tutorial](tutorial.html) shows how to use the most important 
   features of F# DataFrame library. Start here to learn how to use the library in 10 minutes.

 * [Data frame features](features.html) provides more examples that use general data frame 
   features. These includes slicing, joining, grouping, aggregation.

 * [Time series features](timeseries.html) provides more details on operations that are 
   relevant when working with time series data (such as stock prices). This includes sliding
   windows, chunking, sampling and statistics.

 * [API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules
   and functions in the library. This includes additional brief samples on using most of the
   functions.
